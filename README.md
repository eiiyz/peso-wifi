# Piso WiFi Checker
This checker only works for voucher/code based piso WiFi, also it doesn't mean that this shit works for "all" because some code/voucher algo/idn is not the same.

## Usage/Requirements
1. Install Python
2. Install all requirements
3. Change the URL and voucher/code algo/idn, default URL and algo/idn is based on our piso WiFi.
4. Logs success and invalid code res length to identify if invalid or valid (I know there's better method for this shit)
5. Run `python or python3 eiiyz.py`

- First time ko po sa Python, don't judge the judge by the judge <3
